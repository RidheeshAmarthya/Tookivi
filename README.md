The game engine we will be designing will have all the standard features of a rendering engine and all the code will be open source and published in a public domain open to all. This will be done under the Apache License 2.0 which enables the editing and re-using of the code with appropriate acknowledgements. The AI aspect of the engine requires rendering of visual data at a lower resolution to improve performance and then using trained Deep Networks to upscale the image to the native resolution of the user's monitor. The AI will ensure that upscaling will be adding detail rather than averaging the nearby pixels. This will enable the AI-Enabled Game Engine to be accessible to all.
The developed game engine named the Tookivi Rendering Engine (Editor) met all expected performance metrics, averaging 60+ frames per second on a generic everyday system. The AI upscaler was able to enhance the image up to 4 times the resolution with an average frame rate ranging between 15 to 20 frames per second. The expected performance of 30+ frames per second needs more optimization and is left for future development under the future scope of the project.
